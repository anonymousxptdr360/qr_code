👋 Hello everyone!
I’m brand new to GitHub, so please excuse me if things aren’t perfectly clear yet 😅

💻 To start, I’m sharing with you:

🔹 An HTML code to generate simple, secure, fast, and real-time QR codes :

🔹 Another HTML code for a QR code scanner, just as simple and efficient :

✨ Feel free to use them — they’re free and open source !

🌐 All these features are also available on my website:
